Skeleton for a C++ Makefile project


Useful starting point for creating a C++ Makefile project (to creat an executable
or a statically compiled library).

The "includes" folder should contain header files with a *.hpp extension, 
while the "sources" folder should contain source files with a *.cpp extension.
